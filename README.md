# Movie App
## [Link to live preview](https://movie-info-konsta.herokuapp.com/)
This web application is powered by express.js webserver. It uses ejs templates to view fetched data from the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/). For styling the app uses boostrap and a custom stylesheet. The OMDb API is accessed with axios npm-package that provides an easy to use interface to fetch data from REST-apis. After the data is is fetched, it is mapped to a html table element and saved to a variable. This variable is then passed to the main.ejs partial. Main.ejs is then used by the index.ejs page which is hosted in the root directory on the express-webserver. There is 3 different routes showing different content based on api calls. All of the routes use the same index.ejs view and partials with it, but they get loaded with different content depending on the route.
